# EM-GMM-Image-Segmentation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm applied to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for image segmentation and clustering. The code demonstrates the clustering of 2D synthetic data points using the GMM, with real-time visualizations of the algorithm's iterations. This can be extended to image segmentation tasks where GMMs are used to model pixel intensity distributions.

## Features

- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) implementation using scikit-learn
- Real-time visualization of the EM algorithm's iterations
- Example of clustering synthetic 2D data with multiple Gaussian components
- Plotting of Gaussian components as ellipses representing the covariance structure
- Flexibility for adapting the code to image segmentation tasks

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
